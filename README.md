Tachometer for Espruino
=======================

Small application to count ticks from a reed contact and calculate distance as well as current speed.

It is planned to use the [Puck.js](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gfw/puckjs-the-ground-breaking-bluetooth-beacon) as device, and read distance and speed via Bluetooth LE with a smartphone.
